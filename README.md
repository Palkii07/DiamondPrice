                                      Diamond Price Prediction

Overview
This project provides a web application designed to predict diamond prices based on user inputs. The application uses a machine learning model trained on a dataset from Kaggle. The backend is built with Flask, and the application integrates with MongoDB for storing user inputs and prediction results.

Features
Price Prediction: Predicts diamond prices based on features such as carat, depth, table, and more.
User Interface: Simple and intuitive web form for inputting diamond features.
Data Storage: Stores predictions and user inputs in MongoDB.
Modular Code Structure: Organized into components for easy maintenance and scalability.

Installation
Prerequisites
Python: This project requires Python 3.x.
Flask: Web framework used for building the application.
PyMongo: Library for interacting with MongoDB.
scikit-learn: Library used for machine learning and model training.
Pandas: Data manipulation library.
